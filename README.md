# clip_nightbot

The whole purpose of this is to ease the process of clipping
after extensive issue in clipping by my one of the favorite streamer. I have made this </br>

How to Use ? 
first edit `creds.json` with channelid and discord webhook where the request is to be done </br>

Nightbot command:
`â€‹!addcom !clip $(urlfetch http://your_host_here:5001/clip/$(chatid)/$(querystring))`

you can add `-ul=userlevel` userlevel can be found [here](https://docs.nightbot.tv/commands/commands#advanced-usage) to decrease the spam and allow only particular person to do the clipping part (mods etc.)
